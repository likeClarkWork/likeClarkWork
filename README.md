- 👋 Hi, I’m @likeClarkWork
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics and web design and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Python as it's my first language although I am starting to learn HTML/CSS/JS as it lines up more with what I want to do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a score aggreagator that pulls and combines scores from various major marching band circuits into one website. The ones I am open to do are USBands, Bands of America, and Tournament of Bands.
- 📫 You can reach me over Telegram at @ckr517, Instagram using the same username here (just put a period between "like" and "ClarkWork"), and Twitter under WorkinRoundCKR
